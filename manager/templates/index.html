With great power comes great responsibility, etc.  Lots of things don't have confirmation boxes so if you click "Delete" on something, it's going bye-bye.  So... just don't unless you're absolutely sure you know what you're doing.  And even then, stop and think about it first. =)  Confirmation dialogs are on my to-do list, but I just haven't gotten there yet.
